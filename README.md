# Lexical Track Changes

The concept involves creating insert and delete nodes, then developing a custom plugin to monitor specific actions like KEY_DOWN_COMMAND and KEY_BACKSPACE_COMMAND and execute these node insertion and deletion operations accordingly based on the selection. 


This code is a work in progress and likely contains bugs, but it serves as a starting point for implementing track changes using the Lexical Editor.
